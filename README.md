# NECKLACE
## TO DO
### ASAP:
- Figure out how we gonna do this lol
    - Idea so far:
        - Initialize a bunch of shit
        - Each (of 3) ultrasound sensors send a ping (trig) and waits for an echo. They will return to us distance to object in cm (minimal delay)
        - Do some trig and figure out which buzzers to buzz (have someone do trig)
        - Buzz buzzers (have a bool for buzzing?)
            - How strong do we buzz??? Have someone determine intensity function.
            - Proposed: max buzz <= 25cm, min ~3/3.5m
        - Person supposedly is supposed to dodge obstacle.
        - Continue pinging and turn off buzzers once thing is removed
        
- Actually make the device and set up the pins

- Ask for McHacks shirt and make a harness!!!!
    - This is gonna take a lot of crazy arts and crafts skills        

### WHENEVER:
- Build pitch (draft under purpose)
    - We need a cool-ass name lol

- Submit our build to the McHacks site by 10am Sun

- if we have time we can register a domain and make a site with HTML and CSS but only if we have extra time (also note that registering a domain takes hours)

## PURPOSE
-
